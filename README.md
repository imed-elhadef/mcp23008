Embedded Linux C driver for the Microchip I2C GPIO Expander named MCP23008 --> Tested with Raspberry Pi 2 (jessie version)

For this test, I used two GPIOs as output the first GPIO is used for Activating a LED and the second for activating a relay transistor:

GP4 --> Activate a LED
GP5 --> Activate a relay transistor

Two GPIOs as input for two push buttons:

GP6 --> Push button 1
GP7 --> Push button 2

The used will input the right string configuration:

LED : to activate the GP4 ouput 
Relay : to activate the GP5 ouput
Interrupt: to work with the interrupt mode

--> For the Interrupt mode, any interrupt generated by the 2 push buttons will modifiy the signal output for the INT pin which is connected to the Pi board.
